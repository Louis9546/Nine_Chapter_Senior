Description
There are n coins in a line. Two players take turns to take one or two coins from right side until there are no more coins left. The player who take the last coin wins.

Could you please decide the first play will win or lose? Each one will choose the best choice.
Example
n = 1, return true.

n = 2, return true.

n = 3, return false.

n = 4, return true.

n = 5, return true.
Challenge
O(n) time and O(1) memory

Answer:
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param n: An integer
     * @return: A boolean which equals to true if the first player will win
     */
    public boolean firstWillWin(int n) {
        // write your code here
        if(n <= 0) return false;
        
        // State
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        
        // Initialization
        dp[0] = false;
        dp[1] = true;
        
        // Function 
        for(int i = 2; i < n + 1; i++){
            dp[i] = (!dp[i - 1] || !dp[i - 2]);
        }
        
        // Result
        return dp[n];
    }
}
